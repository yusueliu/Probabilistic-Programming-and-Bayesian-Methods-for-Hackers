    "Variational Inference: The basic idea is to pick an approximation $q(\\mathbf{x})$ from some tractable family, and then try to make this approximation as close as possible to the true posterior $p^*(\\mathbf{x}) \\triangleq p(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathcal{D})$, usually by minimizing the KL divergence from $p^*$ to $q$. This reduces inference to an optimization problem. By relaxing the constraints that $q$ is a proper distribution, and/or by approximating the KL objective function, we can trade accuracy for speed."
